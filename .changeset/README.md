# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to add a changeset

1. Run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository
2. Select the packages you want to include in the changeset (use spacebar to select)
3. Choose the version bump type (major, minor, or patch)
4. Write a summary of the changes

The changeset will be saved as a markdown file in this folder. When merged to main,
the release workflow will automatically:

- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Bump package versions
- Publish to npm
- Create GitHub releases
